# Chinese-Diesel-Heater---ESPHome

ESPHome custom component that reads the data from the heater, its the first custom component I have made for esphome, so could probably be much better.

This connects directly to the blue wire (GPIO4) to read the data being transmitted from the controller and then the reply from the heater.

I hope to add control.
